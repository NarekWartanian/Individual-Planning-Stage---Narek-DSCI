    "### Methods and Plan ###\n",
    "In this project, I will use a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict whether a player subscribes to the game-related newsletter based on their demographic characteristics and in-game behavior. The response variable, subscribe, is binary (TRUE/FALSE), making classification an appropriate choice. The KNN algorithm is a non-parametric method that classifies an observation based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is suitable because it can handle non-linear relationships between predictors and the target without assuming a specific functional form. Player behavior and demographics likely have complex, non-linear effects on the probability of subscribing. Additionally, KNN is easy to interpret conceptually and provides a strong baseline model for binary classification problems like this one.\n",
    "Although KNN makes few statistical assumptions, it relies on certain conditions for good performance:\n",
    "Feature scaling: All numeric predictors must be on similar scales, as distance is used to find neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaningful distance metric: Euclidean distance assumes numeric features represent meaningful geometry categorical variables like experience must be encoded properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sufficient and balanced data: KNN requires enough observations from both classes (subscribed and not subscribed) for meaningful local neighborhoods.\n",
    "KNN can be computationally expensive with large datasets, as it stores all observations for distance calculations. It is also sensitive to irrelevant or correlated features and imbalanced data. If one class (e.g., non-subscribers) dominates, the algorithm may bias toward that class. To address this, I will consider feature scaling, potential feature selection, and possibly weighting distances or resampling the data. Choosing the optimal number of neighbors (k) will also be crucial. Too small a k may overfit, while too large may underfit.\n",
    "I will:\n",
    "Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets to evaluate model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cross-validation (5-fold) on the training data to identify the best value of k (number of neighbors) based on classification accuracy or F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall.\n"
