    "This section aims to briefly cover the question and methods of the individual planning stage. The broad question that will be researched in this report is, *What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter?* With the specific question: *Can player demographic and in-game behaviour variables in players.csv and aggregated session statistics from sessions.csv predict whether a player subscribes to the newsletter?*. The response variable in our case is **subscribe** which is either TRUE or FALSE, and the predictor variables will be played_hours, gender, age and average session length which will be calculated using sessions.csv."
